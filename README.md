# GolemHeart

_The heart of a golem gives life to more than just the iron husk around it._

GolemHeart is a new MTG Discord bot designed to enhance public or private MTG discord communities. GolemHeart's features are designed to encourage members to brew decks together, make it easier to play together online, and increase engagement with the community.
___
The bot is currently in the very early stages of development and is not yet available to invite to your Discord server. If you have an idea that would be useful to your MTG community, be sure to submit it in the [Issue Tracker](../../issues).
